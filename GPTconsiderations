# Chat GPT prompt sequence. #
While I have worked with R for a number of years. I have more recently been working with the analysis and coding aspects of ChatGPT and even more recently Code Interpreter.
What took me a couple of days to do manually (DURATION not effort) took me supported by ChatGPT-4 about an hour (probably less as I spent some time workoing out the best prompts), and took Code Interpreter seconds (but I had the basic prompts worked out already, Code Interpreter just went 1 step further and execute the results of the prompt.
ChatGPT-4 also pushed out really well written R script.
